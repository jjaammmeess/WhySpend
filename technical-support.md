## FAQ

### 1. Data missing after switching phones?

- Ensure **iCloud sync** was enabled on the old device with the **same Apple ID**  
- On the new device, sign in to iCloud and open the app; initial cloud import may take time (you can skip the wait screen if offered)  
- If sync was off, data may exist only on the old device — restore from a **JSON backup** from that device if you made one

### 2. Sync errors or “Sync issue”?

1. Check network connectivity  
2. Verify iCloud account status in iOS Settings  
3. Read the message under **Cloud Sync** in the app  
4. Toggle iCloud sync off/on and **restart the app**  
5. Email support if it persists; avoid sending full transaction details in email

### 3. Home Screen name doesn’t match in-app language?

The icon label follows **system language**, not the in-app Language setting. To show **WhySpend** on the Home Screen, set iOS preferred language to English.

### 4. Where is the app version?

**Mine → Help & Support → About → Version**

### 5. Privacy Policy / Terms of Use?
